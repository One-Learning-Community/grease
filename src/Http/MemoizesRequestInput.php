/**
 * Grease HTTP tier — per-instance input memoization.
 *
 * Vanilla {@see InteractsWithInput::input()} rebuilds the
 * merged input map — `$this->getInputSource()->all() + $this->query->all()` — on *every*
 * call, and `all()` wraps that in a fresh `array_replace_recursive(..., allFiles())` every
 * call. Nearly every accessor funnels through them: `__get`, `offsetGet`, `offsetExists`,
 * `toArray`, and most of `InteractsWithData` (`has`/`only`/`except`/`filled`/`whenHas`…),
 * so a single request rebuilds the same array 10–30×. `isJson()` (called by
 * `getInputSource()` on every input read) re-scans the content-type each time too.
 *
 * The merged map is stable for the life of the request once middleware has run, so it's
 * memoized per-instance and invalidated in every Laravel-level mutator. `isJson()` is NOT
 * memoized — the content-type header can change after construction (content-negotiation
 * middleware), and a memo there would freeze a stale answer; it just delegates to vanilla,
 * which is a cheap header scan and, because the input base above is already memoized,
 * runs at most once per input read regardless.
 *
 * Every observable mutation path is tracked. The value mutators (`merge`/`mergeIfMissing`/
 * `replace`/`offsetSet`/`offsetUnset`/`setJson`) flush the base arrays. The lifecycle
 * paths that swap whole bags — `__clone()` (and therefore `duplicate()`), `initialize()`,
 * and `setMethod()` (which rewrites `REQUEST_METHOD`, flipping `getInputSource()` between
 * the query and request bags) — flush as well; `__clone`/`initialize` also drop the
 * `isJson` memo since they can change the content-type.
 *
 * The ONE carve-out (documented, mirrors the Eloquent `$casts`-in-constructor caveat):
 * **direct mutation of an input-source bag** — `$request->query->add(...)`,
 * `$request->request->set(...)`, `$request->json()->set(...)` — bypasses every method and
 * is not cheaply observable, so it's unsupported after the first input read on a greased
 * request. Use the Laravel-level mutators instead, which the memo tracks.
 *
 * Scope of the carve-out (audited per bag — only the input source matters):
 *   - `query` / `request` / `json` — feed `input()`/`all()`. Direct mutation = carve-out.
 *   - `attributes` — route params / middleware context (`$request->attributes->set(...)`).
 *     Read via `attributes->get()` / the deprecated `get()` / `route()`, NEVER by
 *     `input()`/`all()`/`__get`. **Direct mutation is fully safe** — outside the memo.
 *   - `cookies` — not read by `input()`/`all()`. Safe to mutate directly.
 *   - `files` — feeds `all()` via `allFiles()`, but vanilla already caches that
 *     (`$convertedFiles`), so a post-read file mutation is stale in vanilla too — parity
 *     holds, no new caveat.
 *   - `server` / `headers` — `setMethod()` flushes the input base; `isJson()` reads the
 *     content-type live (not memoized), so a header change is reflected. The one residue:
 *     flipping the content-type *after* an input read, which would switch `input()`'s
 *     source bag (JSON vs form), is in the same carve-out as direct bag mutation — exotic
 *     and outside the supported surface.
 *
 * Why this can't be locked down (it was considered): the obvious guard — making the
 * `query`/`request` bag properties private here — is impossible *and* would miss the mark.
 *   1. PHP forbids narrowing an inherited property's visibility ("Access level to
 *      Child::$query must be public (as in class Base)"); these are PHP 8.4 hooked
 *      properties, so even asymmetric `public private(set)` is rejected. And they're read
 *      publicly by Symfony itself (`getInputSource()` reads `$this->query`) and across the
 *      ecosystem (`$request->query->get(...)`), so hiding them would break the framework.
 *   2. Even if it were possible, visibility wouldn't help: the cache-averting call is a
 *      *method on the bag object* (`->query->set()`), reached by *reading* the property.
 *      Visibility governs reading/reassignment, not method calls on the held object.
 * The only true interception — a notify-on-mutate `InputBag` subclass — can't be
 * guaranteed (`duplicate()` hardcodes `new InputBag(...)` via reflection), so it would be
 * leaky. An honest, narrow carve-out is the correct boundary; real apps mutate input via
 * `merge()`/`$request['k'] = …`, not the raw Symfony bags.
