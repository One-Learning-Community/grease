# Changelog

All notable changes to `grease` are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`greaseSerializeDate(string $key): ?string`** on `HasGreasedSerialization` — the
  date-serialization tier's fast path exposed as a standalone primitive, so code that
  *hand-picks* attributes (Scout `toSearchableArray`, a `JsonResource`, an export)
  captures the date win without routing the whole model through `attributesToArray()`.
  Returns byte-identical output to `serializeDate(asDateTime($this->attributes[$key]))`
  (the `toJSON` form), reusing the existing per-class probe — certified classes skip
  the Carbon round-trip, everything else defers to the exact vanilla composition.
  Eligible for timestamps and plain `datetime` / `immutable_datetime` casts;
  −80% on the hand-pick date-serialization path (62.8μs → 12.3μs, fresh-hydrated).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

First release. Opt-in performance for Laravel's hot paths, with output asserted
**byte-identical** to vanilla Eloquent across every cast type, edge value, and
dirty-check.

### Added

- **`HasGrease`** umbrella trait (and a **`GreasedModel`** base class) composing four
  per-model tiers over a single lazily-built, per-class blueprint:
  - **`HasGreasedHydration`** — removes the per-row `ReflectionClass`, the per-instance
    casts rebuild, and `newInstance`'s redundant work during hydration.
  - **`HasGreasedAttributes`** — memoizes `getCasts` / `getCastType` / `getDates` /
    mutator probes / `getDateFormat`; a divergence guard keeps runtime
    `mergeCasts()` / `withCasts()` correct.
  - **`HasGreasedCasts`** — replaces the per-access cast `switch` with a flyweight
    resolved once per cast type, an enum fast path that delegates conversion to the
    framework, and synonym-cast flyweight deduplication.
  - **`HasGreasedSerialization`** — eliminates the Carbon parse-and-reformat round-trip
    for date serialization when a per-class probe certifies the output is a
    byte-identical rewrite; defers to vanilla otherwise.
- **`Grease\Events\Dispatcher`** — a drop-in, behaviour-identical faster event
  dispatcher (no-listener fast path, cached listener resolution, pre-compiled wildcard
  patterns), opt-in via `GreaseEventServiceProvider`. Speeds up every dispatch
  app-wide, not just model events.
- Parity test suite (the byte-identical contract) and a phpbench + real-world
  benchmark harness driven by the same fixtures the tests prove identical.

### Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 12 / 13
